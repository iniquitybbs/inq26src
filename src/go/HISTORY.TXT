iniquity a26 1st release
------------------------

1) removed async pro stuff.
2) added eComm.pas (os2 - and - dos routines)
3) in the os2 version, commented out the part that saves the screen data
   to an ansi because it caused a memory violation.
   ^^FIXED!  (had to seltoflat(scrptr) :)
4) fixed a memory leak when a message gets aborted.
5) commented out scrstorescreen/restorescreen in screen.pas (os2 ver)
   ^^FIXED!  (had to seltoflat(scrptr) :)
6) added %CH (comport handle) to the os2 version's protocol thing.
7) sizeof(pointer^) is not a good idea fiend, changed sizeof(blah^) to
   the actual size parameter of getmem. in the filearea.pas.  was BIG memory
   leak.
8) in function ioClrEol: parameters in vioscrollup needed to be 0-based (-1) :)
   so before the screen didn't clreol correctly.
9) ignore all LF's, in the input routine, to work with telnet clients that
   send crlf.
10) changed max time "default" in levels.pas (for sysop) to 999.  64000
    made some door games mess up.
11) doors.pas : door.sys / dorinfo#.def would show the modems comport when
    LOCAL!.  fixed.
12) doors.pas : if under os2, deinits the modem before loading a door, and
    reinits it upon return.
13) added boolean to global.pas: ignoreLF.  set to false before calling
    iReadkey, and it will not ignore LF's.  (so the nodeChat in nodes.pas
    doesn't get 'stuck' when someone sends a LF [ie: telnet connection]).
14) in detect.pas, line 78, changed it so that the fg color is not changed
    to 0 (black), cause sometimes the screen gets 'stuck' at black and ya
    can't see anything!?!? :P
15) ANOTHER memory leak!!!!!!  textbufsize == 32768 if in dos mode.
    textbuf := sizeof(tscreen); in fastio.pas returns 32768 as the size..
    this is very bad because the screen buffer is actually 4000 bytes and
    when something did a "fillchar(blah, sizeof(tscreen), 0)"; that would
    be overwriting about 30k of memory!
16) config7.pas : Receive and Send "codes" fixed (when you edit them). (protocols)
17) comm.pas : improved the hangup routine a bit.  sometimes it wouldn't hang
    up, or something.
18) datetime.pas : added (day*24*60*60) to dttimer, so it wouldn't go wacky
    if the user logs on right before midnight.
20) in the file editor - if the file area name was too long, it would corrupt
    the screen.  fixed that by changing "iniquity file editor : +fileareaname"
    to just "file editor : +fileareaname".  (config13.pas)
21) removed.
22) lots of ifdef os2's here and there.  this should be #1.  or something
23) fixed ecomm.pas, now works correctly with 57600/115200.  or something (again)
24) if user runs out of time while uploading, the user will get rewarded with
    65535 minutes!? heh
25) At the welcome screen, time would display -65535 minutes
26) (DOS) remote user would sometimes get "garbage"
27) (OS2) Split-Screen chat (alt-x) would sometimes "screw up"
28) If user logs in (from matrix) with wrong password, and leaves feedback,
    It will show that the message was "from" the user he logged on incorrectly
    as.
29) (OS2) Iniquity would crash if user hungup while in the fullscreen editor.

iniquity a26 - May 14, 1997
---------------------------

30) Iniquity would crash if no fossil was loaded. (ioclrscr was being called
    but ioinitfastio wasnt called yet!)
31) "Commented-Out" the avatar detection routine because a lot of times
    It would detect Avatar if ansi was detected.
32) Fixed "unknown user" login bug.
33) (OS2) On some systems it would drop dtr when going into a door.  Since it
    no longer closes the com port before executing the door, you may have to
    add the ,- parameter to your SIO line so os/2 doesn't bitch about the
    modem being in use. (refer to Appendix D. of SIOREF.TXT)
34) If ya uploaded a file with .ZIP, and then a non-archive file, it would
    use the same description from the previous zip.  I'm not 100% sure
    that its fixed, though.

(stuff fixed by fiend, below)

iniq/ log of things i fixed/changed today [03/30/97]   - mike
==============================================================================
! Fixed problems with detecting the correct version of windows
! Fixed input bug where escape would have to be hit twice from the remote end
   to do anything worthwhile.  This was annoying as hell
! Fixed another input bug, where sometimes when holding an extended key (like
   moving the cursor in the fse) would cause weird things to happen, like
   randomly voiding keypresses.  Very annoying
! Fixed bug in IPL where if you use the menucmd[] routine to switch menus,
   the menu that was changed to would start by immediately executing the
   command associated with the key that was pressed to run the IPL module
% The 'exec <filespec>' command in IPL will no longer shell to a dos prompt
   if no params are specified.  Sysops were bombing the remote end to a local
   dos box with simple typos; not good
! Fixed bug where the sysop could not use some of the line chatmode commands
   The more dangerous chat commands only work on the local end, unless the
   user that's online has sysop access (s255, or whatever it's set to)
! Fixed bug where the wrong multinode notice string would be displayed upon
   receiving an incoming message or broadcast from another node
! Fixed some status bar display problems, most due to color codes
